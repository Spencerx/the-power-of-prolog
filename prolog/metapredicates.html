    <center><h1>Higher-order Predicates</h1></center>
    <br>

    Prolog predicates that take <i>predicates</i> as arguments are
    called <b>higher-order predicates</b>, or <b>meta-predicates</b>.

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/metapredicates"><img src="videos/t_metapredicates.png" alt="Meta-Predicates"></a>

    <center><h2 id="call"><tt>call/N</tt></h2></center>

    The <tt>call/N</tt> family
    of <a href="concepts#builtin">built-in</a> predicates allow us to
    call Prolog <i>partial&nbsp;goals</i>
    dynamically. A <b>partial&nbsp;goal</b> is a term that denotes a
    Prolog goal to which zero or more arguments are added before it is
    called.

    <br><br>

    The mechanism to invoke arbitrary Prolog goals dynamically is
    called <b>meta-call</b>, and it is the basic building block by
    which we can define arbitrary meta-predicates in Prolog.

    <br><br>

    Importantly, the <tt>call/N</tt> family of predicates
    retain <a href="purity"><b>logical purity</b></a> of the
    predicates they call.

    <br><br>

    Like most meta-predicates, <tt>call/N</tt> could
    <i>in&nbsp;principle</i> be implemented in&nbsp;Prolog itself. For
    example, we could implement <tt>call/1</tt> as follows, using one
    clause for each available predicate:

    <pre>
call(true).
call(X #= Y)  :- X #= Y.
call(call(G)) :- call(G).
etc.
    </pre>

    Of course, this would need an impractical number of clauses
    in&nbsp;practice, and for this reason the <tt>call/N</tt> family
    of predicates is implemented differently.

    <center><h2 id="maplist"><tt>maplist/N</tt></h2></center>

    The predicates <tt>maplist/2</tt> and <tt>maplist/3</tt> are among
    the most important and most frequently used meta-predicates. All
    widely used Prolog systems provide them as built-in or library
    predicates.

    <br><br>

    The goal <tt>maplist(Pred_1, Ls)</tt> is <i>true</i>
    iff <tt>call(Pred_1, L)</tt> is true for <i>each</i>
    element&nbsp;<tt>L</tt> in the list&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt>.

    <br><br>

    The goal <tt>maplist(Pred_2, As, Bs)</tt> is <i>true</i>
    iff <tt>call(Pred_2, A, B)</tt> is true for each <i>pair</i> of
    elements&nbsp;<tt>A&in;As</tt>
    and <tt>B&in;Bs</tt> that have the same index.

    <br><br>

    There are further predicates in this family
    (<tt>maplist/[4,5,...]</tt>) that are less frequently used.

    <br><br>

    If your Prolog system does not provide these predicates, you can
    easily define them yourself. For example, <tt>maplist/3</tt> is
    declaratively equivalent to:

    <pre>
maplist(_, [], []).
maplist(Pred_2, [A|As], [B|Bs]) :-
        call(Pred_2, A, B),
        maplist(Pred_2, As, Bs).
    </pre>

    Using <a href="macros">goal expansion</a>, the meta-call can
    be compiled away in many cases to improve performance.

    <br><br>

    The primary advantage of <tt>maplist/N</tt> is that you can lift
    any relation that holds for a <i>single</i> element (or single
    pair, triple, etc. of elements) to <i>lists</i> of such elements
    (or <i>corresponding</i> elements).

    <br><br>

    For example, we can state that a term&nbsp;<tt>E</tt>
    is <i>different</i> from <i>all</i> elements in&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt>:

    <pre>
?- maplist(dif(E), Ls).
   Ls = []
;  Ls = [_A], dif:dif(E,_A)
;  Ls = [_A,_B], dif:dif(E,_A), dif:dif(E,_B)
;  Ls = [_A,_B,_C], dif:dif(E,_A), dif:dif(E,_B), dif:dif(E,_C)
;  ... .
    </pre>

    This works in <i>all directions</i>, even if <tt>Ls</tt> is not
    instantiated.

    <center><h2 id="if_3"><tt>if_/3</tt> and related predicates</h2></center>

    The meta-predicate <tt>if_/3</tt> is an important recent
    development that is described
    in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01590"><b><i>Indexing
          dif/2</i></b></a> by Ulrich&nbsp;Neumerkel and Stefan&nbsp;Kral.

    <br><br>

    Implementations are available for:

    <ul>
      <li>SICStus Prolog: <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/sicstus/reif.pl"><tt>library(reif)</tt></a></li>
      
      <li>Scryer Prolog ships with <tt>library(reif)</tt>. Post <tt>?-&nbsp;use_module(library(reif)).</tt> to use <tt>if_/3</tt> and related meta-predicates.</li>

      <li>SWI-Prolog: <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/swi/reif.pl"><tt>library(reif)</tt></a></li>
    </ul>

    Importantly, <tt>if_/3</tt> combines desirable declarative
    properties with good performance in many situations of high
    practical relevance.

    <br><br>

    For example, the predicate <tt>hailstone/2</tt> that is described
    in <a href="concepts#collatz"><b>Basic Concepts</b></a> can be
    expressed with <tt>if_/3</tt> as follows:

    <pre>
hailstone(N, N).
hailstone(N0, N) :-
        R #= N0 mod 2,
        if_(R = 0,
            N0 #= 2*N1,
            N1 #= 3*N0 + 1),
        hailstone(N1, N).
    </pre>

    <tt>if_/3</tt> correctly commits to one of the two alternatives
    when admissible <i>and</i> retains full generality.

    <br><br>

    See also the predicates <tt>tfilter/3</tt>, <tt>tpartition/4</tt> and
    other features that are provided by this important new&nbsp;library.

    <center><h2 id="foldl"><tt>foldl/N</tt></h2></center>

    The <tt>foldl/N</tt> family of predicates describe a <i>fold from
    the left</i> of a list. You can think of a <b>fold</b> as a list
    traversal with intermediate states. An intermediate state
    becomes final when no more elements remain.

    <br><br>

    The most frequently used of these predicates
    is <tt>foldl/4</tt>:

    <br><br>

    <tt>foldl(Pred_3, Ls, S0, S)</tt> describes a fold from the left
    of the list <tt>Ls</tt>, where <tt>S0</tt> is the initial state
    and <tt>S</tt> is the final state. For each
    element <tt>L&in;Ls</tt> and intermediate
    state&nbsp;<tt>S<sub>n</sub></tt>, <tt>call(Pred_3, L,
    S<sub>n</sub>, S<sub>n+1</sub>)</tt> is invoked to relate the
    current list element&nbsp;<tt>L</tt> and intermediate
    state&nbsp;<tt>S<sub>n</sub></tt> to the <i>next</i> intermediate
    state&nbsp;<tt>S<sub>n+1</sub></tt>.

    <br><br>

    Again, these predicates let us focus on the relation for one
    element at a time, and then lift this relation to <i>lists</i> of
    elements.

    <br><br>

    For example, consider the following relation between two integers
    and their <i>sum</i>:

    <pre>
integer_integer_sum(A, B, S) :- S #= A + B.
    </pre>

    Using this relation, we can express the sum of
    a <i>list</i>&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt> of integers with <tt>foldl/4</tt>,
    using 0 as the initial state:

    <pre>
?- foldl(integer_integer_sum, Ls, 0, S).
   Ls = [], S = 0
;  Ls = [S], clpz:(S in inf..sup)
;  Ls = [_A,_B], clpz:(_B+_A#=S)
;  Ls = [_A,_B,_C], clpz:(_B+_A#=_J), clpz:(_C+_J#=S)
;  ... .
    </pre>

    As another example, we can define the <i>maximum</i> of a
    list&nbsp;<tt>Ls</tt> of integers as follows:

    <pre>
list_maximum([L|Ls], Max) :- foldl(maximum_, Ls, L, Max).

maximum_(A, B, Max) :- Max #= max(A, B).
    </pre>

    In this case, we use the first element of the list as the initial state.

    <center><h2 id="solutions">All solutions predicates</h2></center>

    There are several built-in predicates that let us obtain <i>all
      solutions</i> of a predicate.

    <br><br>

    These predicates transform solutions that are normally found on
    backtracking to <i>lists</i> of solutions. The former is sometimes
    called a <i>temporal</i> representation, and the latter
    a <i>spatial</i> representation.

    <br><br>

    The most important such predicates
    are <tt>bagof/3</tt>, <tt>setof/3</tt>
    and <tt>findall/3</tt>.

    <br><br>

    In general, reasoning about the database in this way
    destroys <i>monotonicity</i> of your programs: After <i>adding</i>
    a clause, goals that previously succeeded may&nbsp;<i>fail</i> if
    these predicates are used. This may
    render <a href="debugging">declarative debugging</a> approaches
    inapplicable. One way to see why these predicates are problematic
    is to observe that <tt>(\+)/1</tt> ("not&nbsp;provable") can be
    implemented via&nbsp;<tt>findall/3</tt>:

    <pre>
\+ Goal :- findall(., Goal, []).
    </pre>


    For this reason, use these predicates with caution.

    Neumerkel's <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/ISO-Hiord.html"><tt>library(lambda)</tt></a>
    is an important recent proposal for
    <i>lambda&nbsp;expressions</i> in ISO&nbsp;Prolog. Use this
    library in cases where you would like to call variations of
    predicates without introducing auxiliary&nbsp;predicates.

    Richard O'Keefe's
    draft, <a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/ok/pllib.htm">An
    Elementary Prolog Library</a>, also contains descriptions and
    implementations for many important higher-order predicates.

    <br><br>

    <tt>meta_predicate</tt> declarations provide sufficient
    type&nbsp;information to make code&nbsp;analysis tools such as
    cross-referencers work with meta-predicates.
