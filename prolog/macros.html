    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>

    In the Lisp community, <i>macros</i> are always a big&nbsp;deal. A
    Lisp macro <i>rewrites Lisp&nbsp;code</i>.

    <br><br>

    Very often, the phrase "code is data" is used in this context. But
    this also holds for example for C and Java&nbsp;code: C code
    is <i>also</i> data, and you can store and access C&nbsp;code as a
    plain text&nbsp;file. Therefore, this does not capture the main
    reason why we should care about Lisp macros especially. In a more
    limited sense, a C preprocessor <i>also</i> supports&nbsp;macros.

    <br><br>

    What, then, <i>is</i> the core difference between Lisp and C
    macros? Clearly, Lisp macros are much more powerful <i>because
    they can easily analyze Lisp code</i>. Why is this? Because Lisp
    code has a <b>natural, structure-preserving representation</b> as
    a Lisp data structure! This is <i>not</i> the case for&nbsp;C
    or&nbsp;Java. For example, there is no built-in data structure
    in&nbsp;C that faithfully represents C source&nbsp;code in a
    <i>structure-preserving&nbsp;way</i>. We can represent C
    source&nbsp;code within C as an array of characters, but that does
    not preserve the <i>abstract structure</i> of the source code, and
    it makes basic operations extremely hard. For example:

    <ul>
      <li>Which variable names occur in the program?</li>
      <li>How many if-then-else constructs are used in the code?</li>
      <li>Are there tail-recursive functions?</li>
    </ul>

    These are questions that are hard to answer in the case of&nbsp;C
    because it is hard to reason about the structure of
    C&nbsp;programs in an abstract way, at least much harder than it
    is in the case of&nbsp;Lisp.

    <br><br>

    The point of this page is to show you that Prolog has a mechanism
    that works much like <b>macros</b> in&nbsp;Lisp. In fact, macros
    are a lot easier to write in Prolog for several reasons. For
    example, you do not have to <i>quote</i> Prolog code when
    reasoning about&nbsp;it or generating&nbsp;it, and you cannot
    accidentally run into name&nbsp;clashes with different
    variables. This simplicity is the main reason why Prolog
    programmers are not as hysteric about this feature as several
    other language communities. In Prolog, this facility is simply
    available, and easily used when needed.

    <br><br>

    <center><h2>Code is more than data</h2></center>

    Of course, <i>code is data</i>: We write it down, we read it.
    Prolog code is <i>more</i> than simply "data" though: Every Prolog
    clause is a valid <a href="data"><b>Prolog&nbsp;term</b></a>.
    This is
    <i>structured</i>&nbsp;data, which we can analyze and process
    systematically using <a href="concepts#builtin"><i>built-in
        features</i></a> of&nbsp;Prolog.

    For example, consider a simple Prolog <i>rule</i>:

    <pre>
f(X, Y) :- g(X), h(Y).
    </pre>

    This is the following Prolog <i>term</i>:

    <ul>
      <li>the <a href="data#term"><i>functor&nbsp;name</i></a>
        is <tt>:-</tt>, and the <i>arity</i> is&nbsp;2</li>
      <li>the first <i>argument</i> of the term is the term <tt>f(X, Y)</tt></li>
      <li>the second argument is the compound term <tt>','(g(X),
          h(Y))</tt>, which in turn again has two arguments.
      </li>
    </ul>

    If you are ever unsure about what a term "actually" is,
    use <tt>write_canonical/1</tt> to obtain the
    term's <b>canonical&nbsp;form</b>:

    <pre>
?- write_canonical( <b>(f(X, Y) :- g(X), h(Y))</b> ).
<b>:-(f(A,B),','(g(A),h(B)))</b>
    </pre>

    In the canonical form, all compound&nbsp;terms are output
    in <i>functional&nbsp;notation</i>.

    <br><br>

    Note that we have used parentheses around the term to properly
    indicate the single argument of <tt>write_canonical/1</tt>.

    <center><h2>Rewriting Prolog code</h2></center>

    All widely used Prolog systems provide mechanisms that let
    us <i>rewrite Prolog code</i> <b>at compilation time</b>.

    <br><br>

    The advantage is clear: We can perform complex transformations of
    Prolog code <i>once</i> at compilation time, resulting in often
    faster code at <i>run&nbsp;time</i>.

    <br><br>

    In Prolog systems, this facility is typically provided
    by <i>extensible</i> predicates such as <tt>term_expansion/2</tt>
    and <tt>goal_expansion/2</tt>. These predicates take
    2&nbsp;arguments:

    <ul>
      <li>the first argument is a Prolog term as it occurs in the
        program that is being compiled</li>
      <li>the second argument denotes the <i>replacement</i> of the term.</li>
    </ul>

    If a clause of this extensible predicate succeeds, then the
    replacement&nbsp;term is used <i>instead</i> of the
    original&nbsp;term during compilation.

    <br><br>

    If your Prolog system does not provide this facility, you can
    easily implement it yourself, using the built-in
    predicate <tt>read/1</tt> to read Prolog terms from a file.

    <br><br>

    The exact semantics of these predicates differ between
    Prolog&nbsp;systems, for example regarding questions such as:

    <ul>
      <li>Are the <i>virtual</i> read-term <tt>beginning_of_file</tt>
        and <tt>end_of_file</tt> made available for expansion?</li>
      <li>Are expansions themselves subject to expansion?</li>
      <li>Are <i>meta-calls</i> automatically expanded at run-time?</li>
      <li>Are <i>queries</i> subject to goal expansion?</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    A common standard would be nice.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2>Examples</h2></center>

    See the <a href="dcg#implementation">implementation
    of&nbsp;DCGs</a> for an example of <i>term</i> expansion that is
    used in almost all widely available Prolog&nbsp;systems. In this
    case, the expansion mechanism is used to <i>automatically</i>
    equip DCG&nbsp;rules and all DCG&nbsp;nonterminals with 2
    additional&nbsp;arguments in a systematic&nbsp;way.

    <br><br>

    In Scryer Prolog, <a href="clpfd">integer arithmetic</a> serves
    as an example of <i>goal</i> expansion. For instance, consider the
    following Prolog rule whose body consists of a single&nbsp;goal:

    <pre>
integer_successor(I0, I) :- <b>I #= I0 + 1</b>.
    </pre>

    To see how this is automatically expanded, declare the predicate
    dynamic via the <tt>dynamic/1</tt> directive, and
    use <tt>listing/1</tt> from <tt>library(format)</tt>:

    <pre>
<b>?- listing(integer_successor/2).</b>
integer_successor(A,B) :-
   (  integer(B) ->
      (  integer(A) ->
         B=:=A+1
      ;  C is B,
         clpz:clpz_equal(C,A+1)
      )
   ;  (  integer(A) ->
         (  var(B) ->
            B is A+1
         ;  C is A+1,
            clpz:clpz_equal(B,C)
         )
      ;  clpz:clpz_equal(B,A+1)
      )
   ).
    </pre>

    This example illustrates that low-level integer arithmetic is
    <i>automatically</i> used whenever possible, even if we use
    higher-level constructs which <i>also</i> work in other directions.
