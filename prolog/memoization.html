    <center><h1>Memoization</h1></center>

    <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>

    The two best rules for
    improving <a href="efficiency">efficiency</a> of
    Prolog&nbsp;programs were given by Richard&nbsp;O'Keefe:

    <ol>
      <li>Don't do it.</li>
      <li>Don't do it again.</li>
    </ol>

    To illustrate option&nbsp;1: If we need to solve a&nbsp;task that
    is exorbitantly&nbsp;hard, we could look&nbsp;for a different,
    easier task&nbsp;whose results <i>approximate</i> optimality
    within a sufficient&nbsp;range.

    <br><br>

    In this text, we discuss option&nbsp;2, that is ways to not do
    it&nbsp;<i>again</i>. The common theme is that we
    <i>remember</i> results of previous computations, which is a
    technique known as <i>memoization</i> in computer&nbsp;science.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2 id="tabling">Tabling</h2></center>

    <b>Tabling</b> is a <i>built-in</i> method to apply memoization to
    Prolog predicates. This means that the underlying Prolog system
    can <i>automatically</i> perform memoization for&nbsp;you, if you
    request&nbsp;it. Tabling is also known
    as <b>SLG&nbsp;resolution</b>.

    <br><br>

    Different Prolog systems provide tabling in various forms and with
    different
    characteristics. <a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/">XSB&nbsp;Prolog</a>
    is one of the pioneering systems in this area, and some of its
    techniques are now becoming more widely available also in other
    systems. Your Prolog system's&nbsp;manual should contain the exact
    details.

    <br><br>

    For example, to enable tabling in Scryer&nbsp;Prolog, you need to:

    <ol>
      <li>Use <tt>library(tabling)</tt> via the directive <tt>:-
          use_module(library(tabling)).</tt> in your source&nbsp;file.</li>
      <li>Enable tabling via the <tt>table/1</tt> directive.</li>
    </ol>

    Hence, to enable tabling
    for <a href="nontermination"><tt>adjacent/2</tt></a>, you can write:

    <pre>
<b>:- use_module(library(tabling)).

:- table adjacent/2.</b>

adjacent(a, b).
adjacent(e, f).
adjacent(X, Y) :- adjacent(Y, X).
    </pre>

    In this case, tabling has made the predicate <i>terminating</i>:

    <pre>
?- adjacent(X, Y), false.
   <b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    As the second example, let us consider the series
    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number"><b>Fibonacci&nbsp;numbers</b></a>,
    which we can describe in Prolog for example as follows:

    <pre>
fibonacci(0, 1).
fibonacci(1, 1).
fibonacci(N, F) :-
        N #> 1,
        N1 #= N - 1,
        N2 #= N - 2,
        fibonacci(N1, F1),
        fibonacci(N2, F2),
        F #= F1 + F2.
    </pre>

    The relation works as intended in the most general case:

    <pre>
?- fibonacci(N, F).
   N = 0, F = 1
;  N = 1, F = 1
;  N = 2, F = 2
;  N = 3, F = 3
;  N = 4, F = 5
;  ... .
    </pre>

    It can also be used for more specific queries:

    <pre>
?- fibonacci(17, F).
   F = 2584
;  false.
    </pre>

    However, the computation runs out of stack or takes too long for
    larger arguments:

    <pre>
?- fibonacci(100, F).
<b>ERROR: Out of local stack</b>
    </pre>

    We can easily enable tabling by adding the following directives to
    the&nbsp;file:

    <pre>
:- use_module(library(tabling)).

:- table fibonacci/2.
    </pre>

    Using SLG resolution, the answer to the previous query is now
    readily&nbsp;found:

    <pre>
?- fibonacci(100, F).
   <b>F = 573147844013817084101</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    Tabling also allows you to
    use <a href="dcg#leftrecursion">left-recursive&nbsp;DCGs</a> for
    parsing. For example, you can add the directive:

    <pre>
:- table tree_nodes//1.
    </pre>
    
    to apply tabling to the DCG nonterminal <tt>tree_nodes//1</tt>.

    <br><br>

    Scryer Prolog implements tabling via <i>delimited
    continuations</i>. See the
    paper <a href="https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/6880648/file/6885145.pdf"><i>Tabling
    as a Library with Delimited Control</i></a> by Benoit
    Desouter&nbsp;<i>et&nbsp;al.</i> for more information.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2>Doing it manually</h2></center>

    We can <i>emulate</i> tabling by <i>manually</i> storing results
    in the global&nbsp;database.

    <br><br>

    Consider for example the following definition of <tt>memo/1</tt>:

    <br><br>
    <pre class="box">
:- dynamic(memo_/1).

memo(Goal) :-
        (   memo_(Goal)
        -&gt;  true
        ;   once(Goal),
            assertz(memo_(Goal))
        ).
    </pre>
    <br><br>

    As long as <tt>Goal</tt> is semi-deterministic or deterministic,
    <tt>memo(Goal)</tt> is equivalent to <tt>Goal</tt>
    and <i>reuses</i> results that have already been computed. This
    leads to a technique known as <i>dynamic&nbsp;programming</i> in
    computer&nbsp;science.

    <br><br>

    Note that this is less powerful than tabling: First, it
    requires <i>modifications</i> of the original program that go
    beyond adding simple directives. You have to manually wrap the
    goals for which you want to enable memoization
    with&nbsp;<tt>memo/1</tt>. Second, this rather <i>ad&nbsp;hoc</i>
    definition does not help to improve termination&nbsp;properties of
    your programs. On the plus side, the technique can still help to
    improve performance tremendously when it is applicable, and it
    is <i>portable</i> to all Prolog&nbsp;systems.

    <br><br>

    Applied to <tt>fibonacci/2</tt>, it could look as follows:

    <pre>
fibonacci(0, 1).
fibonacci(1, 1).
fibonacci(N, F) :-
        N #> 1,
        N1 #= N - 1,
        N2 #= N - 2,
        <b>memo</b>(fibonacci(N1, F1)),
        <b>memo</b>(fibonacci(N2, F2)),
        F #= F1 + F2.
    </pre>

    Sample query and answer:

    <pre>
?- fibonacci(100, F).
<b>F = 573147844013817084101</b>.
    </pre>


    <br><br>
    <center><h2>Doing it more explicitly</h2></center>

    In many cases, we want more explicit control over what is being
    stored. For example, we may want to ensure that we do not
    accidentally clutter the global database or tabling storage. In
    such cases, we can carry around a custom "database" of existing
    results as predicate <i>arguments</i>.

    <br><br>

    We can use <a href="dcg#semicontext">semicontext notation</a> to
    carry around the state <i>implicitly</i> while still retaining
    full control over the storage.

    <br><br>

    As an example, we present the calculation of the <b>minimum
      edit&nbsp;distance</b> between two lists, using the
      nonterminals <a href="dcg#state"><tt>state//1</tt></a>
      and <a href="dcg#state"><tt>state//2</tt></a>:

    <pre>
min_edit(As, Bs, Min-Es) :-
        empty_assoc(Assoc0),
        phrase(min_dist(As, Bs, Min-Es), [Assoc0], _).

min_dist([], [], 0-[]) --&gt; [].
min_dist(As, Bs, Min-Es) --&gt;
        (   state(S0), { get_assoc(store(As,Bs), S0, Min-Es) } -&gt; []
        ;   { findall(option(Action,Cost,As1,Bs1),
                      edit_option(As, Bs, Action, Cost, As1, Bs1),
                      Options) },
            assess_options(Options, CostOptions),
            state(S0, S),
            { keysort(CostOptions, [Min-Es|_]),
              put_assoc(store(As,Bs), S0, Min-Es, S) }
        ).

assess_options([], []) --&gt; [].
assess_options([option(Action,Cost,As,Bs)|Options], [Min-[Action|Es]|Rest]) --&gt;
        min_dist(As, Bs, Min0-Es),
        { Min #= Min0 + Cost },
        assess_options(Options, Rest).
    </pre>

    This code is quite flexible, and can be adapted to various use
    cases by providing a suitable definition
    of&nbsp;<tt>edit_option/6</tt>, declaratively describing the
    actions that are allowed to transform one list into another. For
    example, a typical use case may look like&nbsp;this:

    <pre>
edit_option([A|As], Bs, drop(A), 1, As, Bs).
edit_option(As, [B|Bs], insert(B), 1, As, Bs).
edit_option([A|As], [A|Bs], use(A), 0, As, Bs).
    </pre>

    This means that there are three possible actions (dropping,
    inserting and using an element), with associated costs of one, one
    and zero, respectively.

    <br><br>

    Example query and answer:

    <pre>
?- min_edit("abcef", "axbdef", Min).
<b>   Min = 3-[use(a),insert(x),use(b),drop(c),insert(d),use(e),use(f)]</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    If it were implemented naively, <tt>min_edit/3</tt> would exhibit
    <i>exponential</i>&nbsp;runtime in the length of the lists. Using
    memoization has reduced this to polynomial&nbsp;runtime.
