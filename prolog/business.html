    <center><h1>Prolog Business Cases</h1></center>
    <br><br>

    To establish the use of Prolog in an organization, management must
    be made&nbsp;aware of the immense benefits it has from
    a <i>business&nbsp;perspective</i>, such&nbsp;as:

    <ul>
      <li>Prolog is <b>ISO&nbsp;standardized</b>. This is an extremely
        important asset from a legal perspective, since it means that
        Prolog&nbsp;vendors can be <i>held&nbsp;accountable</i> when
        violating the standard.</li>
      <li>Prolog <b>cuts&nbsp;costs</b>: Since Prolog programs are
        so&nbsp;general, you typically need <i>less&nbsp;code</i>,
        which you can type, read and audit in less&nbsp;time.</li>
      <li>Prolog has a proven <b>track&nbsp;record</b> in many very
      serious applications. See for example the SICStus
        <a href="https://sicstus.sics.se/customers.html">customer&nbsp;references</a>.</li>
      <li>Prolog is ideally suited for <b>rule&nbsp;based</b> systems
        that express your <b>business&nbsp;rules</b>.</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    In any organization, there are countless possible applications
    for&nbsp;Prolog. In the following, we consider some of them.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2 id="database">Prolog as a database</h2></center>

    One of the <i>most basic</i> use cases of Prolog is to rely on its
    ability to act as a&nbsp;<b>database</b>.

    <br><br>

    By this, we mean applications that simply <i>store&nbsp;data</i>
    and make it available for <i>querying</i>.

    <br><br>

    Prolog is very well suited for such applications, since you can
    dynamically add and remove data, and rely on
    automatic <i>indexing</i> to obtain good performance in many
    situations of practical relevance. Also, you can easily edit and
    process Prolog&nbsp;programs by various means, which makes
    exporting, importing and processing the accumulated knowledge in
    general very convenient. In addition, formulating Prolog queries
    is often more natural and easier than formulating
    SQL&nbsp;queries. For such reasons, Prolog is often a good
    alternative for other database systems.

    <br><br>

    There is a syntactic subset of Prolog that is
    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog"><b>Datalog</b></a>,
    and it is especially suitable for such use&nbsp;cases.

    <br><br>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><i>Video</i>:</td>
        <td><a href="videos/datalog"><img src="videos/t_datalog.png" alt="Datalog"></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br><br>

    You can also use the <i>Constraint Query
    Language</i>&nbsp;<a href="http://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc/_SWI_/library/cql/cql.pl">CQL</a>
    to seamlessly access SQL&nbsp;databases from Prolog.

    <br><br>
    <center><h2>Analyzing events and anomalies</h2></center>

    A <b>logfile</b> records events.


    For example, you can configure a
    Prolog <a href="web#server">HTTPS&nbsp;sever</a> to store
    information about <i>requests</i> it&nbsp;processes.

    <br><br>

    When you locally test such a server by fetching the
    page <a href="/prolog"><tt>/prolog</tt></a>, it may write an entry
    similar to the following in its logfile:

    <pre>
/*Sun Apr  9 23:01:19 2017*/
request(45, 1491771679.213,
         [peer(ip(127,0,0,1)),
          method(get),request_uri('/prolog'),path('/prolog'),
          http_version(1-1),host(localhost),port(3037),
          connection('keep-alive'),upgrade_insecure_requests('1'),
          if_modified_since('Wed, 05 Apr 2017 23:24:08 GMT')]).
    </pre>

    This entry describes the <i>request</i> of the&nbsp;client.

    <br><br>

    After processing the request, the server may write an additional
    entry that describes how the request was processed. For example,
    it may add:

    <pre>
completed(45, 0.0009790000000000076, 0, 304, not_modified).
    </pre>

    The key point is that you can configure the server so that the
    logfile is a series of Prolog&nbsp;<i>facts</i>. Hence, the whole
    logfile can be easily analyzed <i>using&nbsp;Prolog</i>!

    <br><br>

    A single invocation of Prolog suffices to <i>load the
    entire&nbsp;file</i>, and at the same time makes it ready for
    posting arbitrary&nbsp;queries over the accumulated&nbsp;data.

    <br><br>

    For example, in the case above, we can ask: <i>Are there any
      client&nbsp;requests that were not served?</i> In Prolog,
      this&nbsp;becomes:

    <pre>
?- request(R, _, _), \+ completed(R, _, _, _, _).
<b>false.</b>
    </pre>

    In our case, this means that the server at least <i>handled</i>
    each request in some&nbsp;way, and did not silently
    ignore&nbsp;one.

    <br><br>

    Of course, not <i>all</i> logfiles can be parsed directly
    with&nbsp;Prolog. However, the more you use Prolog&nbsp;syntax
    within your organization, the more you will benefit from being
    able to post queries over such&nbsp;data. In addition, you can
    typically easily convert any logfile format to valid
    Prolog&nbsp;facts, and then apply the same&nbsp;reasoning.

    <center><h2>Rule-based reporting</h2></center>

    In every organization, there is a constant need for
    excellent&nbsp;<b>reports</b>. Prolog is ideally suited
    for <i>generating</i> such reports from available&nbsp;data.

    <br><br>

    For example, imagine you are responsible for reporting the number
    of monthly <i>visitors</i> of your company's&nbsp;homepage.
    Further, for historic&nbsp;reasons, your team of technicians sends
    you the <i>average&nbsp;number</i> of
    visitors <i>per&nbsp;day</i>, at the end of each&nbsp;month. That
    is, the data you have available is stored in the following
    convenient form, using Prolog&nbsp;facts, indicating a nice growth
    of daily visitors to your&nbsp;site:

    <pre>
year_month_daily_visitors(2017, jan, 30018).
year_month_daily_visitors(2017, feb, 32913).
year_month_daily_visitors(2017, mar, 35871).
    </pre>

    However, your management wants <i>you</i> to report
    the <i>total</i> number of visitors for each&nbsp;month, not the
    daily&nbsp;average.

    <br><br>

    Using Prolog <b>rules</b>, it is straight-forward
    to <i>convert</i> your data to the data that
    your <i>management</i> wants to&nbsp;see. For example,
    using <a href="clpfd">integer&nbsp;arithmetic</a>, we can readily
    relate the daily&nbsp;average to the monthly&nbsp;total:

    <pre>
year_month_total(Year, Month, Total) :-
        Total #= Days*Daily,
        year_month_days(Year, Month, Days),
        year_month_daily_visitors(Year, Month, Daily).
    </pre>

    This only requires the definition of <tt>year_month_days/3</tt>,
    with clauses that may look as&nbsp;follows:

    <pre>
year_month_days(2017, jan, 31).
year_month_days(2017, feb, 28).
year_month_days(2017, mar, 31).
    </pre>

    This suffices to produce the answers we need, for example:

    <pre>
?- year_month_total(Year, Month, Total).
   Year = 2017, Month = jan, Total = 930558
;  Year = 2017, Month = feb, Total = 921564
;  Year = 2017, Month = mar, Total = 1112001.
    </pre>

    Using <tt>format/2</tt>, you can turn this into a more readable report:

    <pre>
?- <b>format("year month visitors~n", []),</b>
   year_month_total(Year, Month, Total),
   <b>format("~d ~q ~t~U~20|~n", [Year,Month,Total]),</b>
   false.
<b>year month visitors
2017 jan     930_558
2017 feb     921_564
2017 mar   1_112_001</b>
    </pre>

    Notice the use of <i>forced backtracking</i>
    via <a href="concepts#builtin"><tt>false/0</tt></a>.

    <br><br>

    A few weeks later, management needs a different report: They now
    want neither the daily average, nor the total number, but rather
    the <i>cumulative&nbsp;sum</i> of visitors for the current
    year, <i>up&nbsp;to</i> and including the current&nbsp;month.

    <br><br>

    Using Prolog, it is straight-forward to generate this report by
    simply <i>formulating the required&nbsp;rules</i>, while retaining
    the original&nbsp;data exactly as it&nbsp;was. For example:

    <pre>
cumulative(Pred, Until, C) :-
        months(Ms),
        cumulative_(Ms, Pred, Until, 0, C).

cumulative_([], _, _, C, C).
cumulative_([M|Ms], Pred, Until, C0, C) :-
        C1 #= C0 + Current,
        call(Pred, M, Current),
        if_(M=Until, C=C1,
            cumulative_(Ms, Pred, Until, C1, C)).

months([jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sept,oct,nov,dec]).
    </pre>

    This uses the
    meta-predicates</a> <a href="metapredicates#call"><tt>call/3</tt></a>
    and&nbsp;<a href="metapredicates#if_3"><tt>if_/3</tt></a> to
    describe the cumulative&nbsp;sum in a very general and
    flexible&nbsp;way. For example:

    <pre>
?- cumulative(year_month_total(2017), M, C).
   C = 930558, M = jan
;  C = 1852122, M = feb
;  C = 2964123, M = mar
;  false.
    </pre>

    As a special case of this query, we can of course also inquire any
    particular&nbsp;month:

    <pre>
?- cumulative(year_month_total(2017), feb, C).
   <b>C = 1852122</b>
;  false.
    </pre>

    Note the massive advantages of such a way to <i>reason</i> about
    your data. For example, it suffices to send
    around <i>Prolog&nbsp;facts</i>, which you can easily do via
    plain&nbsp;text. Augmenting these facts is also very easy: It
    suffices to add one fact per month to keep the above
    report&nbsp;current.

    <center><h2>Strategic considerations</h2></center>

    Suppose you are successfully applying Prolog within your company
    to solve difficult problems. Would you publicly announce the fact
    that you are using Prolog, so that your competitors can benefit
    from the same technology? My personal guess is: <i>No</i>,
    you <i>wouldn't</i>.

    <br><br>

    Sometimes, when you introduce Prolog in an organization, people
    will dismiss the language because they have never heard of anyone
    who uses&nbsp;it.
    Yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190203010151/https://www.sics.se/projects/sicstus-prolog-leading-prolog-technology"><b>a
    third of all airline tickets</b></a> is handled by systems that
    run SICStus&nbsp;Prolog. NASA uses SICStus&nbsp;Prolog for a
    voice-controlled system onboard the International
    Space&nbsp;Station. Windows&nbsp;NT used an embedded Prolog
    interpreter
    for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040603192757/research.microsoft.com/research/dtg/davidhov/pap.htm">network&nbsp;configuration</a>.

    dominant <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CHR/files/Elston_SecuritEase.pdf">stock
    broking system</a> is written in Prolog and&nbsp;CHR. Prolog is
    used to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15293v1">reason about
    business&nbsp;grants</a> in Austria.

    <br><br>

    A commercial Prolog system easily costs <i>thousands</i> of
    dollars. This is not software you "just&nbsp;buy" as an
    individual. A professional Prolog system is typically bought by
    companies who simply <i>need</i> the power of&nbsp;Prolog to solve
    their&nbsp;tasks. They are unlikely to advertise their internal
    technologies. Still, a few of them do. For example, the
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-0-preface7.html">Java
    Virtual Machine Specification</a> contains a lot of
    Prolog&nbsp;code, and
    <a href="https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/ALP/2011/03/natural-language-processing-with-prolog-in-the-ibm-watson-system/">IBM&nbsp;Watson
    uses&nbsp;Prolog</a> for natural language processing.

    <br><br>

    Sometimes, instead of trying to introduce Prolog in an
    organization, it is more efficient to start working for one where
    it is already being&nbsp;used!
